## Discussion 

Let's pick up where we left off in the TicTacToe project. We have successfully created a webservice
in Spring Boot and AngularJS which handles user authentication, the handling of the game logic and 
the creation of game rooms. 


Now I want to try and add websockets into the mix. First I want to see if I can bring together the 
TicTacToe and ChatSocket projects and place a chat room inside each game room.
